This repository contains a collection of anti-reflective devices and caps for various optics, flashlights, lasers and night vision.

Note: The Trijicon RMR ARD does not mount to the optic to stay on when used on a handgun, and needs to be redesigned.

## Manufacturing guidelines

If using FDM printer recommend use PAHT-CF or some other Nylon for all parts.
Make sure layer lines are positioned correctly.

If you want to make these parts out of metal the QLS fork needs material removed since metal is not as flexible.

I am not responsible for any injuries from misuse or improper manufacturing.
